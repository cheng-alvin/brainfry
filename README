Brain-Fry
=========

A stupid and simple Brain F*ck compiler for x64, supports emitting ELF64
object files. This project uses my library - Jas to compile assembly code
down into a plain ELF file. Just like the Brain F*ck language itself, its
not wasn't ever designed to be used for writing actual software, rather its
a proof of concept for the Jas assembler.

Please see https://github.com/cheng-alvin/jas if you're interested in deve-
loping compilers and applications like this. 

In order to build the compiler, simply run `make` in the root directory, 
all linking and everything will be automatic.


Usage: ./brainfry <file>
